    /*
     * In Java, a lambda expression is a short-handed way to create an
     * object from an interface with a single abstract method.
     * Here is the syntax for an interface whose one abstract method has
     * 2 input parameters with a return type of int:
     *
     *      <InterfaceType> variableName = (input1, input2) -> {
     *          // Some code
     *          return 0;
     *      }
     *
     * Objects can't be created from interfaces so the lambda expression
     * creates an anonymous class (and object) that implements the interface.
     *
     * Unlike JavaScript, Java can't assign method definitions to variables
     * so this syntax is a work-around for that. That is why the
     * lambda expression syntax looks like a method definition:
     *      (inputParameter1, inputParameter2) -> { // code for method }
     *
     * If an interface has more than 1 abstract method then a lambda expression
     * can't be used. An interface with exactly 1 abstract method is called
     * a Functional Interface.
